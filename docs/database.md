we will store the invoice information in the database with the invoice hash, the salt and the merchants address we will show store the expireytime of this invoice and also the status of the invoice like expired pending or settled .

for the explorer the user can use the invoice hash to find the invoice and we will use rthe database to show the informastionn 
if the user chooses to use the salt then also we can use the database to show


in the profile page i am thinking of showing the user about the details of the invoice like the amount, salt hash and the expiry time , this amount will be visible to only the owner of this invoice man keep this in mind we will also show the merchant their all invoices their status and a total count also like these many invoice you have made these many are pending and these many are expired and these many are settled,
