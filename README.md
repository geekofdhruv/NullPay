# NullPay

**Privacy-first payment protocol built on Aleo blockchain with zero-knowledge proofs**

NullPay is a decentralized invoice and payment system that leverages Aleo's zero-knowledge cryptography to enable private, verifiable transactions. Merchants can create invoices without revealing sensitive information on-chain, and payers can settle invoices while maintaining complete anonymity.

**Live Application:** [https://null-pay.vercel.app/](https://null-pay.vercel.app/)  
**Smart Contract:** [`zk_pay_proofs_privacy_v7.aleo`](https://testnet.explorer.provable.com/program/zk_pay_proofs_privacy_v7.aleo)

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Zero-Knowledge Invoices**: Merchant addresses and amounts are hashed on-chain using BHP256, preserving privacy
- **Private Transfers**: Payments executed via Aleo's `transfer_private`, hiding payer identity and balances
- **Standard Invoices**: Single-payment invoices that close upon settlement
- **Multi Pay Campaigns**: Multi-contributor invoices with individual payment receipts
- **Tamper-Proof Verification**: Mathematical hash verification prevents invoice manipulation
- **Encrypted Metadata**: Off-chain data encrypted with AES-256-GCM for additional security
- **Payment Receipts**: Unique receipt keys generated via cryptographic commitments for multi-pay tracking

### User Experience
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection with Aleo wallet adapters (Leo Wallet, Puzzle Wallet, etc.)
- **Invoice Explorer**: Real-time tracking of invoice status and transaction history
- **Merchant Dashboard**: Track created invoices, payment status, and settlement options
- **Responsive Design**: Premium glassmorphism UI with fluid animations

---

## Architecture

NullPay consists of three main layers:

### Layer 1: Frontend (React + TypeScript)
The client-side application handles:
- Salt generation using `crypto.getRandomValues()` (128-bit entropy)
- Wallet adapter integration for transaction signing
- Invoice hash computation (client-side verification)
- Transaction submission to Aleo network
- Record management for private payments

### Layer 2: Smart Contract (Leo)
The on-chain protocol `zk_pay_proofs_privacy_v7.aleo` enforces:
- Hash integrity verification (`assert_eq(computed_hash, stored_hash)`)
- Invoice status management (0 = Open, 1 = Settled)
- Conditional payment logic (Standard vs Multi Pay)
- Replay protection via payment receipt tracking
- Private transfers through `credits.aleo`

### Layer 3: Backend (Node.js + Supabase)
The indexer and database layer provides:
- Fast invoice lookups without querying blockchain repeatedly
- AES-256-GCM encrypted storage for merchant/payer addresses
- Transaction history aggregation
- RESTful API for frontend data access

**Data Flow:**
```
Merchant → Frontend → Smart Contract → Blockchain
                ↓
           Backend DB (Encrypted)
                ↓
           Payer → Frontend → Verify Hash → Pay Invoice
```

## Smart Contract

The core contract `zk_pay_proofs_privacy_v7.aleo` is deployed on Aleo Testnet.

**Explorer Link:** [https://testnet.explorer.provable.com/program/zk_pay_proofs_privacy_v7.aleo](https://testnet.explorer.provable.com/program/zk_pay_proofs_privacy_v7.aleo)

### Transitions

#### 1. `create_invoice`
Creates a new invoice (Standard or Multi Pay).

**Inputs:**
- `merchant: address` (private) - Merchant's Aleo address
- `amount: u64` (private) - Invoice amount in microcredits
- `salt: field` (private) - Random 128-bit salt
- `expiry_hours: u32` (public) - Invoice expiry (0 = no expiry)
- `invoice_type: u8` (public) - 0 = Standard, 1 = Multi Pay

**Outputs:**
- `invoice_hash: field` (public) - BHP256-based hash of merchant + amount + salt

**On-chain Storage:**
- `invoices[hash]` → `{ expiry_height, status: 0, invoice_type }`
- `salt_to_invoice[salt]` → `hash`

#### 2. `pay_invoice`
Pays an existing invoice.

**Inputs:**
- `pay_record: credits` - Private credit record for payment
- `merchant: address` - Merchant address from invoice link
- `amount: u64` - Amount from invoice link
- `salt: field` - Salt from invoice link
- `payment_secret: field` (private) - Unique secret for receipt generation
- `message: field` (public) - Optional public message (e.g., invoice_hash)

**Behavior:**
- **Standard Invoice (type 0):** Asserts `status == 0`, then sets `status = 1` (closed)
- **Multi Pay Invoice (type 1):** Creates receipt key `BHP256::commit_to_field(payment_secret, salt_scalar)`, stores in `payment_receipts[receipt_key] = amount`. Invoice remains open.

**Security:**
- Verifies `computed_hash == salt_to_invoice[salt]`
- Prevents replay attacks (asserts receipt key doesn't exist)

#### 3. `settle_invoice`
Allows merchant to manually close a multi-pay campaign.

**Inputs:**
- `salt: field` (public) - Invoice salt
- `amount: u64` (private) - Invoice amount (for hash verification)

**Authorization:**
- Only merchant can call (verified via `self.caller` hash reconstruction)

**Effect:**
- Sets `status = 1`, preventing further payments

### Data Structures

```leo
struct InvoiceData {
    expiry_height: u32,    // Block height for expiry (0 = no expiry)
    status: u8,            // 0 = Open, 1 = Settled
    invoice_type: u8       // 0 = Standard, 1 = Multi Pay
}

mapping invoices: field => InvoiceData;
mapping salt_to_invoice: field => field;
mapping payment_receipts: field => u64;  // Multi Pay payment tracking
```

## Security

### On-Chain Privacy
- **Merchant Address:** Hashed with BHP256 before storage
- **Invoice Amount:** Hashed with BHP256 before storage
- **Salt:** 128-bit entropy (2^128 search space)
- **Payer Identity:** Hidden via `transfer_private`
- **Payment Receipts:** Commitment scheme prevents receipt forgery

### Off-Chain Security
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption:** Merchant and payer addresses encrypted at rest
- **Authenticated Encryption:** GCM mode provides integrity and confidentiality
- **Environment Variables:** Encryption keys stored securely
- **HTTPS Required:** Production deployments must use HTTPS

### Attack Mitigations
- **Replay Protection:** Payment receipts prevent duplicate payments with same secret
- **Hash Verification:** `assert_eq(computed_hash, stored_hash)` prevents tampering
- **Double-Spend Prevention:** Aleo's serial number system prevents record reuse
- **Expiry Enforcement:** Block height checks prevent payment of expired invoices

---

## Future Roadmap

Planned features for upcoming releases:

1. **Treasury Management:** Multi-signature wallets for merchant payouts
2. **Record Privacy:** Store amounts as private records instead of public fields
3. **SDK:** JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for third-party integrations
4. **Expiry Enforcement:** Automatic invoice expiration
5. **Categorization:** Tag-based invoice organization
6. **Mobile App:** React Native application
7. **Enterprise Features:** Bulk invoicing, reporting, webhooks

See [`docs/future_wave.md`](./docs/future_wave.md) for detailed roadmap.
